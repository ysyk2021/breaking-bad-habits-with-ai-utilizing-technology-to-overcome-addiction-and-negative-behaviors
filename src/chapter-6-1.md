AI-powered support platforms can integrate with mental health resources, providing users with access to professional guidance and treatment options when needed.

**Data-Driven Insights**

AI can analyze data from group interactions to provide insights into trends, challenges, and successes. This information can inform the development of more effective support strategies.

**Privacy and Confidentiality**
